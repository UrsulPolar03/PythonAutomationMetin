# PythonAutomationMetin
My second Python code that I've written, similar to Piano Tiles code but more complex.

By using Pyautogui library, this code can play by itself Metin 2. It will automatically search for "Metin stones" by automatically looking around, automatically go to their position, automatically destroy them, automatically picking up the loot and look for the next "Metin stone" repeating the entire process.

For the code to perfectly work, you must do:
Screen resolution: 1920x1080
Metin 2's client resolution: 1280x720
Metin 2's client position: WINDOWED on top left corner of the screen
